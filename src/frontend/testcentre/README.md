## Test Centre role in Plagiarism Step Functions workflow

The flow for use of the Test Centre is:

- A Step Functions execution is initiated.
- An exam attempt is generated.
- A mail is sent to the student, with a link in the following format:

`GET https://testcentre.example.com/?ExamID=foo&IncidentId=bar&TaskToken=baz`

- A student then completes a test. Once done, a request is sent back to Step Functions as a POST request, to an API Gateway endpoint, with their score and the task token:

`POST https://1234567890-abcdefgh.amazonaws.com/submitExam`

**Payload**
```
{
  "ExamId": "food",
  "IncidentId": "bar",
  "TaskToken": "baz",
  "Score": "69"
}
```

# Deploying

1. This project is designed to deploy via the Amplify Console.

2. It assumes you have already deployed the parent `AWSStepFunctionsPlagiarismDemo.`

3. Get the API Gateway endpoint after it is deployed:

`aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name aws-step-functions-plagiarism-demo --query 'Stacks[].Outputs' | grep api`

4. Then, create a new Amplify Console project.

5. Connect it to a repository hosting this code, then set an enviromnet variable called `APIGW_ENDPOINT` with the value that you just got from the CloudFormation output.

6. Deploy the site.

7. The TestCentre will be available at the root of the site, with the admin site under /admin.
