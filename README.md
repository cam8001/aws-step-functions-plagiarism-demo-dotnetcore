## AWS Step Functions Plagiarism Demo Dotnetcore

A simple workflow for developing AWS Step Functions to demonstrate how you can combine AWS Step Functions with AWS Lambda using DotNetCore 2.0, and the Serverless Application Model (SAM), and expose your workflow via an API Gateway!

### The Scenario

To illustrate the use of [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) I have created a scenario that describes a process where university students caught plagiarising on exams and/or assignments are required to take a test to assess their knowledge of the universities referencing standards.

Visually, the process looks like this:

The process starts by:

1. Registering the plagiarism incident
2. Scheduling an exam. Students have one week to complete the test.
3. Send the student an email notification to inform them of the requirement
4. The process waits for the exam dedline to complete, before
5. Validating the results
6. Determining whether or not the student has sat the exam, or passed. Students get three attempts to pass the exam before...
    * The incident is resolved, or
    * Administrative action is taken.

### The Architecture

This example uses a simple architecture, hosting a static website in [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Amazon S3) using Vue.js to invoke an [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) API. The API is configured with an AWS Service integration which invokes the [AWS Step Function](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) state machine for the plagiarism workflow. Along the way, the task states in the state machine are executing [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions which are periodically persisting data to [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and send messages via [Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/).

## What's in this repo?

* `AWSStepFunctionsPlagiarismDemo` - contains all the project files for the demo.
* `www` - sample Vue.js SPA to invoke the API.

## Getting started

* Deploy the SAM template with the Step Function definition (see the `AWSStepFunctionsPlagiarismDemo/README.md` for more detail.
* Get the API Gateway endpoint from the deployed CloudFormation outputs, and add it to `www/js/config.js`.
* Subscribe to the SNS topic created by CloudFormation.
* Deploy the www folder to a static web server (for example, s3, Amplify, or locally with npm `http-server`)
* Start a new job from the web page, and watch the State Machine execute in the AWS console.

### Cookiecutter SAM for DotNet Lambda functions

The application was initialised using the Cookiecutter SAM for DotNet Lambda functions. The cookiecutter template provides a wizard like command line experience to create a Serverless app based on SAM and .NET Core 2.1.

For more details check out https://github.com/aws-samples/cookiecutter-aws-sam-dotnet

Also, a great video tutorial on how to use the Cookiecutter (and more) can be found on the AWS Twitch channel - [Build on Serverless | Building the "Simple Crypto Service" Python Project](https://youtu.be/D8u7I_qXZH4)
