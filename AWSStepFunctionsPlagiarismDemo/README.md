## Developing with AWS Step Functions using .NET Core

### Requirements

* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) already configured with PowerUser permission
* [.NET Core 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/) installed
* [AWS Extensions for .NET CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-extensions-for-dotnet-cli) installed
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) installed
* [AWS SAM CLI](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local) installed
* [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) installed if you are using Linux & macOS

#### macOS

You can install Mono and Dotnet on MacOS with brew:

`brew install mono && brew cask install dotnet-sdk`

The brew scripts update your path; you'll need to open a new Terminal window to
start using the install scripts.

Then:

`dotnet tool install -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools`

### Recommended Tools

* [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/)
* [Cake Build](https://cakebuild.net/docs/editors/) Editor support for Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio.

### Other resources

* [AWS Lambda for .NET Core](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-dotnet)
* [Creating .NET Core AWS Lambda Projects without Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/creating-net-core-aws-lambda-projects-without-visual-studio/)
* [The official AWS X-Ray SDK for .NET](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-dotnet)

## Build, Packaging, & Deployment

This solution comes with a pre-configured Cake (C# Make) script which provides a cross-platform build automation system with a C# DSL for tasks such as compiling code, copying files and folders, running unit tests, compressing files and building NuGet packages.

The build.cake script has been set up to:

* Build your solution projects
* Run your test projects
* Package your functions
* Run your API in SAM Local.

To execute a build use the following commands:

### Linux & macOS

```bash
sh build.sh --target=Package
```

### Windows (Powershell)

```powershell
build.ps1 --target=Package
```

To package additional projects / functions add them to the build.cake script "project section".

```csharp
var projects = new []
{
    sourceDir.Path + "RegisterIncident/RegisterIncident.csproj",
    sourceDir.Path + "{PROJECT_DIR}/{PROJECT_NAME}.csproj"
};
```

AWS Lambda C# runtime requires a flat folder with all dependencies including the application. SAM will use `CodeUri` property to know where to look up for both application and dependencies:

```yaml
...
    RegisterIncidentFunction:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
            CodeUri: ./artifacts/RegisterIncidentFunction.zip
            ...
```

### Deployment

First and foremost, we need an `S3 bucket` where we can upload our Lambda functions packaged as ZIP before we deploy anything - If you don't have a S3 bucket to store code artifacts then this is a good time to create one:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, run the following command to package our Lambda function to S3:

```bash
sam package \
    --template-file template.yaml \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, the following command will create a Cloudformation Stack and deploy your SAM resources.

```bash
sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name aws-step-functions-plagiarism-demo \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

> **See [Serverless Application Model (SAM) HOWTO Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/HOWTO.md) for more details in how to get started.**


After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name aws-step-functions-plagiarism-demo \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
```


## Testing

For testing our code, we use XUnit and you can use `dotnet test` to run tests defined under `test/`

```bash
dotnet test RegisterIncident.Test
```

Alternatively, you can use Cake. It discovers and executes all the tests.

### Linux & macOS

```bash
sh build.sh --target=Test
```

### Windows (Powershell)

```powershell
build.ps1 --target=Test
```

### Local development

Given that you followed Packaging instructions then run the following to invoke your function locally:


**Invoking function locally through local API Gateway**

```bash
sam local start-api
```

**SAM Local** is used to emulate both Lambda and API Gateway locally and uses our `template.yaml` to understand how to bootstrap this environment (runtime, where the source code is, etc.) - The following excerpt is what the CLI will read in order to initialize an API and its routes:

```yaml
...
Events:
    sam-app:
        Type: Api # More info about API Event Source: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#api
        Properties:
            Path: /hello
            Method: get
```

If the previous command run successfully you should now be able to hit the following local endpoint to invoke your function `http://localhost:3000/REPLACE-ME-WITH-ANYTHING`.


# Appendix

## AWS CLI commands

AWS CLI commands to package, deploy and describe outputs defined within the cloudformation stack:

```bash
aws cloudformation package \
    --template-file template.yaml \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME

aws cloudformation deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name aws-step-functions-plagiarism-demo \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
    --parameter-overrides MyParameterSample=MySampleValue

aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name aws-step-functions-plagiarism-demo --query 'Stacks[].Outputs' \
    | grep api
```

## Bringing to the next level

Here are a few ideas that you can use to get more acquainted as to how this overall process works:

* Create an additional API resource (e.g. /hello/{proxy+}) and return the name requested through this new path
* Update unit test to capture that
* Package & Deploy

Next, you can use the following resources to know more about beyond hello world samples and how others structure their Serverless applications:
